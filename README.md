## Authentication.
One of the disadvantages of the project is authentication. Currently, there isn't any security for users. it permits only authenticated users to access the resources. Also, it gives users other benefits if included like the history of video watched and stored video as a wishlist in case they need to view or purchase later.

## AWS for storing images and video.
When it comes to storing large information like images and video, its always best to keep it away from the director where the files are stored. A good example would be AWS S3. Simple Storage Service (S3) is a good place to store your files. S3 can serve files directly to your users or application through HTTP. Your files are stored in something called buckets. File URLs will look something. This information can be stored in the database. Which can be accessed using a link. I have used youtube to display the video for the tutorial, Youtube is an example. The files are stored elsewhere but can be assessed using a link id which works with a URL to display.
